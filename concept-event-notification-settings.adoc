You can configure event notification settings to send e-mail, Syslog, and AutoSupport messages if an event occurs.

If event notification settings are not configured when a Hyper-V parent host is added to SnapManager for Hyper-V, you can configure those settings later, using the Configuration wizard.

You can change the event notification settings by using the Configuration wizard even after the host has been added to SnapManager for Hyper-V.

You can configure the event notification settings before you can add virtual machine resources to a dataset.
