You can perform a cluster operating system (OS) rolling upgrade to upgrade the OS of the cluster nodes without stopping SnapManager for Hyper-V. This feature supports SLA compliance by reducing downtime.

Failover clusters running SnapManager for Hyper-V can be upgraded from Windows Server 2012 R2 to Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019 with no downtime.

For information on cluster OS rolling upgrade benefits, installation process and limitations refer to the related information.
