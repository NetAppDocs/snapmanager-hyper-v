You can configure report path settings so that you can store reports for SnapManager for Hyper-V operations. You must configure the report path settings before you can add virtual machine resources to a dataset.

If the report settings are not configured when a Hyper-V parent host is added to SnapManager for Hyper-V, you can configure (and even change) those settings later, using the Configuration wizard.

If you configure the report path settings for a parent host cluster, you must manually create the report directory on each cluster node. The report path should not reside on a cluster shared volume (CSV) or a shared LUN.
