* *Message*
+
`Some of the storage system snapshots required to restore the VM are missing or inconsistent.`

* *Description*
+
If storage system volumes are renamed, you cannot restore a virtual machine (VM) from its backup that was created prior to renaming volumes.

* *Corrective Action*
+
If storage system volumes are renamed and you need to restore a VM from a backup created prior to renaming volumes, then complete the following:

 ** While restoring a VM from MMC, make sure that "Enable Snapshot Verification" option is unchecked in the **Restore Options**page of the Restore wizard.
 ** While restoring a VM by using PowerShell, make sure that -DisableVerifySnapshot parameter is specified.
