* *Issue*
+
If you perform a failover and failback, you may not be able to restore VMs on your primary site from a backup created on the same primary site, before the failover.

* *Cause*
+
Snapshot copy verification uses volume GUIDs. GUIDs changes after disaster recovery.

* *Corrective Action*
+
You can disable the Verify Snapshots option through the PowerShell or the Restore wizard:

 ** Uncheck the "Enable Snapshot Verification" option in the *Restore Options* page of the Restore wizard.
 ** Using PowerShell, make sure that -DisableVerifySnapshot parameter is specified.
