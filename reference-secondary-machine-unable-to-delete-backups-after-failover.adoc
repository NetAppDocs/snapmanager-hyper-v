* *Message*
+
`The specified backup does not exist for some of the objects in the dataset.`

* *Description*
+
After failover to a secondary site (site B), you may be unable to delete backups created at the primary site (site A). If you are at a disaster recovery site (site B), and attempt to delete backups made at the primary site (site A), you will be deleting backups from the primary (site A) rather than the disaster recovery site (site B).

* *Corrective action*
+
After performing disaster recovery operations, only delete backups that were made at your current site of operation.
