* *Issue*
+
Storage performance may degrade following a failed backup job.

* *Cause*
+
If the Microsoft Hyper-V VSS components experience an exception during a backup, the cluster shared volumes (CSVs) might remain in redirected I/O mode, causing I/O overhead and potential bottlenecks within the Windows Failover Cluster. This can lead to overall performance degradation, with the greatest impact to VMs residing on the CSV in redirected I/O mode.

* *Corrective action*
+
Contact Microsoft Support for assistance with this issue.
