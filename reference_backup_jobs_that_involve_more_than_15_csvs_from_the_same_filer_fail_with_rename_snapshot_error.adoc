= Backup jobs that involve more than 15 CSVs from the same storage system might fail
:icons: font

* *Issue*
+
SnapManager for Hyper-V backup jobs that involve more than 15 Cluster Shared Volumes (CSVs) from the same storage system fail with the following error:
+
----
Failed to rename the Snapshot copy of the LUN to the new Snapshot copy name.	
Error code: The attempt to get the named attribute for the LUN on the storage system failed.
Error code: 13057.
Error description: An error occurred in the reception and processing of the API reply from the appliance.
----

* *Cause*
+
This is a limitation caused by Data ONTAP to prevent a hold of system resources. The limitation of 15 LUNs is applicable only when all of the LUNs belong to the same storage system. If a backup dataset is created so that no more than 15 CSVs are involved from one storage system, then this issue does not occur.

* *Corrective action*
+
If you want to make a backup that includes more than 15 LUNs from the same storage system, create multiple datasets to avoid this failure.
