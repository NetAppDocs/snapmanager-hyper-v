= Backup reports use management console time zone information in report name
:icons: font

* *Issue*
+
When you generate a backup report using a client host that resides in a different time zone than the parent host, the report name uses the client host time zone information and the report contents use the parent host time zone.

* *Cause*
+
The timestamp in the backup report name appears with the client host time zone information.

* *Corrective action*
+
No corrective action is necessary.
