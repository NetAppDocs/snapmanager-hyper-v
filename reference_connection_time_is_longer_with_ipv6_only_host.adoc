* *Issue*
+
If you are working in a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment and you add an IPv6-only host to SnapManager for Hyper-V, the connection might take longer than normal.

* *Cause*
+
This delay occurs because SnapManager for Hyper-V tries IPv4 protocol first.

* *Corrective action*
+
To work around this delay, add the host in the \windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file.
