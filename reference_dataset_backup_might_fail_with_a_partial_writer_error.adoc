* *Description*
+
This message appears when performing an application-consistent backup of a dataset. This error causes the backup to fail for some of the virtual machines in the dataset.

* *Corrective action*
 ** Retry the dataset backup.
 ** If the retry attempt fails again, split the dataset into two datasets so that all the VMs whose backup failed will be placed into a single dataset and all other VMs will be put into another dataset. Then run the backup again.
