* *Issue*
+
After adding new nodes to a Windows Failover Cluster, datasets are not automatically transferred to the new node.

* *Cause*
+
When adding new nodes to a Windows Failover Cluster, SnapManager for Hyper-V does not automatically replicate the existing datasets to the new nodes in the cluster.

* *Corrective action*
+
Run the Modify Dataset wizard and click *Update Schedule Policies to all the Dataset member nodes* on the Basic Details page.
+
This wizard must be run for each dataset that has virtual machines.
