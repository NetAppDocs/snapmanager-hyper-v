* *Message*
+
SnapManager for Hyper-V is not licensed on the host or in the Storage System, backup is aborted

* *Description*
+
This message occurs either when your system is not licensed or when there are issues with enumeration, virtual machine caching, or master boot record (MBR) disk use.

* *Corrective action*
 .. Ensure that your system is licensed.
 .. Migrate any MBR disks, which SnapManager for Hyper-V does not support, to GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks.
 .. Restart SnapManager for Hyper-V.
If this does not resolve the issue, you most likely have an enumeration problem and should contact technical support.
