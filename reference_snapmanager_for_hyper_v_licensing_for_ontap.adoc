[.lead]
SnapManager for Hyper-V licensing depends on the version of ONTAP that you use.

For host-based licensing and storage-based licensing, you must use Data ONTAP 8.0 or later.

You must use Data ONTAP 8.2 or later of MultiStore (vFiler unit) for use with SnapManager for Hyper-V.

If you are using a version of Data ONTAP prior to 8.2, there are some restrictions on certain operations.
