= Virtual machine managing itself
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Issue*
+
If a virtual machine (VM) belongs to a host that has SnapManager for Hyper-V installed, and you install SnapManager for Hyper-V on that VM to use as a management console, you should not use SnapManager for Hyper-V to manage the host to which the VM belongs.

* *Cause*
+
SnapManager for Hyper-V on a virtual machine cannot manage itself.

* *Corrective action*
+
No corrective action necessary.

* *Example*
+
If VM1 belongs to Host1 (with SnapManager for Hyper-V installed), and you install SnapManager for Hyper-V on VM1, you should not use SnapManager for Hyper-V to manage Host1 from VM1.
+
If you do this, and try to restore the VM from itself, the VM will be deleted or restarted from Hyper-V Manager.
