= VSS returns errors against Microsoft iSCSI Target VSS Hardware Provider during NAS backup
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Issue*
+
While performing a NAS backup, the following errors might occur:
+
Vss Requestor - Backup Components failed. Failed to add volume [example] to snapshot set. The shadow copy provider had an unexpected error while trying to process the specified operation.
+
Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Error creating the Shadow Copy Provider COM class with CLSID [example]. Access is denied.

* *Cause*
+
These errors occur during a NAS application-consistent backup. NAS backup does not fail, but VSS logs some errors related to Microsoft iSCSI Target VSS Hardware Provider.

* *Corrective action*
+
The backup has not failed; you can safely ignore these errors.
