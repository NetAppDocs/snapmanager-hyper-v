= Web Service Client channel unable to connect while updating the dataset to the new node
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ./media/

* *Issue*
+
If a Web Services Client is not explicitly started, it will fail to connect to SnapManager for Hyper-V.

* *Cause*
+
SnapManager for Hyper-V no longer automatically starts a Web Services Client channel. If the Web Service Client channel is unable to connect while updating a dataset to a new node, it may be for one of the following reasons:

 ** Web Services has not been started.
 ** SnapManager for Hyper-V is not installed.
 ** The Web Services host is down.

* *Corrective action*
+
To correct this behavior, be sure you have performed the following tasks:

 ** Start Web Services.
 ** Install SnapManager for Hyper-V.
 ** Restart the Web Services host.
