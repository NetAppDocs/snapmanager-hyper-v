You can add a Hyper-V parent host or host cluster to back up and restore your virtual machines.

.Steps
. From the navigation pane, click *Protection*.
. From the Actions pane, click *Add host*.
. Run the *Add host* wizard.

.After you finish
When you add a host to a cluster, the information about the new host is not automatically displayed in the GUI. Manually add the host information to the xml file in the installation directory.

SnapManager for Hyper-V must be installed on each cluster node. If you do not have SnapManager for Hyper-V installed, you are prompted to run the Remote Host Install wizard.
