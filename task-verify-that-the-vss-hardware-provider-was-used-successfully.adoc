You can verify that the Data ONTAP VSS Hardware Provider was used successfully after a Snapshot copy was made.

.Steps
. Navigate to menu:System Tools[Event viewer > Application] in MMC and look for an event with the following values:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| Source| Event ID| Description
a|
Navssprv
a|
4089
a|
The VSS provider has successfully completed CommitSnapshots for SnapshotSetId id in n milliseconds.
|===

NOTE: VSS requires that the provider commit a Snapshot copy within 10 seconds. If this time limit is exceeded, the Data ONTAP VSS Hardware Provider logs Event ID 4364. This limit could be exceeded due to a transient problem. If this event is logged for a failed backup, retry the backup.
