You can create datasets for virtual machine resources that share the same protection requirements. You can add virtual machines to multiple datasets, as necessary.

You must have the following information available:

* Dataset name and description
* Virtual machine resources you plan to add to the dataset

Dedicated and shared disks that belong to the same host cluster should not be placed in the same dataset. Adding these types of resources to a single dataset can cause the dataset backup to fail. You can have only one type of VM per dataset: NAS or SAN. You cannot have mixed-mode datasets.

The Validate Dataset check box is selected by default. SnapManager for Hyper-V checks for any configuration errors in all VMs during the creation or modification of a dataset. You must ensure that the check box is not selected if you do not want to enable validation of the dataset.

. From the navigation pane, click *Protection* > *Datasets*.
. From the Actions pane, click *Create dataset*.
. Complete the pages of the wizard.

You should next add protection policies to the dataset that you created.
