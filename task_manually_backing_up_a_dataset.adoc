You can create an on-demand backup of a dataset.

You must have the following information available:

* Backup name and description
* Policy name, if necessary
* Policy override information (if you plan to change any of the previously specified policy options)
* Backup type
* Backup options information

. From the navigation pane, click *Protection* > *Datasets*.
. Select the dataset for which you want to create a manual backup and click *Backup*.
+
The Backup wizard appears.

. Complete the steps in the wizard to create your on-demand backup.
+
Closing the wizard does not cancel the on-demand backup.

You can view the status of the on-demand backup in the Jobs Management window.
