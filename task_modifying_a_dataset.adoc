After you have created a dataset, you can modify the dataset description and the resources associated with the dataset.

The Validate Dataset check box is selected by default. SnapManager for Hyper-V checks for any configuration errors in all VMs during the creation or modification of a dataset. You must ensure that the check box is not selected if you do not want to enable validation of the dataset.

. From the navigation pane, click *Protection* > *Datasets*.
. Select the dataset that you want to modify.
. From the Actions pane, click *Modify dataset*.
. Complete the steps in the wizard.
