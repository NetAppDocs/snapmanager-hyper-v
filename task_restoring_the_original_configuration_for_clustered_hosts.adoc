. Offline the virtual machine resource and virtual machine configuration resource for all the VMs.
. Delete these resources from the cluster.
. Delete all the VMs from Hyper-V Manager.
. Disconnect all the disks by using SnapDrive.
. Resynchronize the SnapMirror relationship from the primary storage system to the secondary storage system.
